AWS VPC ( Virtual Private Cloud )
=================================

Virtual Private Cloud
---------------------

VPC is a logically isolated virtual private network. Each aws account holder have it's own dedicated vpc environment. In this VPC environment we can use other aws resources, scale up and scale down resources as per our needs.

When we create aws account, a default VPC is created. In one aws account we can have 5 vpc.One vpc can have 200 subnents and 200 route table.

Region / Availability Zones
---------------------------

AWS insfrastructure i.e data centers are available accross the globe. Every location is term as 'Region' in AWS.

Within the Region we have multiple physical locations with redundant power, networking. These locations gives high availablity and fault tolerance. These locations are term as Availability Zones (AZs).

Edge Location
-------------

AWS data centers are desinged to give deliver services with the low latency. Amazon have dozens of data centers spread across the glob which are closer to users than Region and availablity zones, often in major cities

CIDR ( Classless Inter-Domain Routing )
---------------------------------------

While creating vpc we need to give the ip address range from private ip address range in the CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) form, example 10.0.0.0/16.

IPv4 Range
==========
10.0.0.0    - 10.255.255.255
172.16.0.0  - 172.31.255.255
192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255

Subnets
-------

A subnet is the range of ip address within the VPC. When we create subnet we need to give the valid ip address range which should be the subset of vpc ip address range. Once the subnet is created we can launch AWS resources such as EC2.

Each subnet must reside within one AZ and it cannot be spanned across AZs.

Subnet Types

- Private subnets traffics are not routed to an Internet Gateway so that it can not reach to the public internet.

- Public subnets traffics are routed to an Internet Gateway so that it can be reached to the public internet.

- VPN only Subnets are not routed to Internet Gateway but are routed to virtual private gateway for Site-to-Site VPN connection.

Route tables
------------

A route table contains a set of rules, that determines how the network traffic will flow from VPC, these rules are called routes.

A Subnet can be associated with a particular route table or else it is associated with the main route table.

A route table consist of ip address range (destination) where you want the traffic to go and gateway or network interfaces through which this traffic will go (targets).

Propagation, allows virtual private gateway to automatically route to the route table i.e we don't need to manually enter the VPN routes to route table

Edge association
----------------
For routing inbound VPC traffic to an appliance, we need to associate a route table with internet gateway or virtual private gateway and specify network interface as target.

Internet Gateway
----------------

An internet gateway allows the subnet network traffic to have access to the public internet.

A default VPC is already attached to the internet gateway and all the default subnets route table have the internet gateway destination.

Each instances in the default subnet have private and public ip address

Egress only internet gateway
----------------------------

EIGW allow outbound communication via IPv6 from instances and prevent internet from initiating IPv6 connection.

EIGW works only with IPv6 network.


NAT Gateway
-----------

A NAT gateway is a Network Address Translation service. This service allows instances in the private subnet to have access to the services outside of the VPC but external services cannot have access to those instances

VPC Endpoints
-------------

VPC Endpoints enables communication between VPC and supported aws services without the need of internet i.e without using NAT gateway or public ip address.

Types of VPC endpoints

- Gateway endpoint, is a route in the route table in which target is the 'Gateway EndPoint' and destination is the AWS Service.

As if now below two AWS Services are supported:
- AWS S3 ** this is also available for Interface Endpoint
- AWS Dynamodb

Gateway Endpoint is attached to Private Subnet, so that Private subnet can reach to the AWS services without having the Internet Access.
